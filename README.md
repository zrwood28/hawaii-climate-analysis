# sqlalchemy-challenge
Climate analysis of Honolulu by exploring a weather database.

## Summary
Using two SQLite tables that involved Hawaii climate data, multiple analyses were conducted in order to create a Flask site to hold various sets of information. SQLAlchemy was also used in order to allow an interaction with the database within Python. Once dependencies were imported and a connection was established, data analysis began. The first major exploration involved identifying the most recent year's worth of data and creating a visual to display the observed rainfall throughout the year. Data was collected from nine unique stations across the region. The second analysis explored temperature measurements from the most active station, Waihii. A Flask server was made displaying some of this data, and the values of interest were formatted using JSON.
